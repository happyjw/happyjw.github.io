In 2005 we bought a Roomba red and used it for a couple of years before moving
onto our sailboat where we didn't need it anymore. I passed it on to my sister, who
used it for a couple more years before she also didn't need it anymore and put it
into storage until now.

I wasn't surprised that the original NiMh battery would no longer take a charge,
but $26 on Amazon was all it took to fix that - and the Roomba is once again alive,
much to the annoyance of our dog
